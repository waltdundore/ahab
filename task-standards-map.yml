      - "IT-PGAS-2"  # Software development lifecycle
    rationale: |
      Analyzing the structure of Georgia CS standards requires systematic thinking and
      pattern recognition. This task involves identifying organizational patterns,
      extracting numbering systems, and mapping taxonomies - all analytical skills
      that align with IT-CSP-5. The systematic approach mirrors software development
      lifecycle planning (IT-PGAS-2).

      - "IT-PGAS-2"  # Software development lifecycle - prototyping
      - "IT-ITS-1.3"  # Critical thinking and problem-solving
    rationale: |
      Creating proof-of-concept mappings demonstrates how Ahab features translate
      educational intentions (teaching CS concepts) into computational artifacts
      (working infrastructure). This is the essence of IT-CSP-6. The prototyping
      approach aligns with IT-PGAS-2's emphasis on prototype development models.
    contribution: "Validates the educational approach and mapping methodology"

      - "IT-CSP-4"  # Programs to process and extract information
      - "IT-PGAS-5"  # Digital representations of media (data formats)
    rationale: |
      Creating a YAML registry demonstrates data abstraction (IT-CSP-3) by organizing
      complex standards information into a structured, machine-readable format. The
      registry enables programmatic processing of standards data (IT-CSP-4) and shows
      how to represent educational information digitally (IT-PGAS-5).
    contribution: "Creates the central data structure for all standards work"

  task_6_2:
    task_id: "6.2"

      - "IT-ITS-1.3"  # Critical thinking and problem-solving
    rationale: |
      Property-based testing demonstrates advanced algorithmic thinking (IT-CSP-5)
      by defining universal properties that should hold across all inputs. This
      testing approach is part of professional software development (IT-PGAS-2)
      and requires critical analysis of system behavior (IT-ITS-1.3).
    contribution: "Ensures registry data quality through automated validation"

      - "IT-NSS-10"  # Network operation and management procedures (validation)
    rationale: |
      Writing validation scripts demonstrates programming for data processing (IT-CSP-4)
      and algorithm development (IT-CSP-5). The validation approach mirrors network
      diagnostic testing procedures (IT-NSS-10) - both verify system correctness.
    contribution: "Automates quality assurance for standards data"

  task_7_1:
    task_id: "7.1"

      - "IT-CSP-6"  # Translate human intention into computational artifacts
      - "IT-NSS-9"  # Network design using standards and analysis
    rationale: |
      The feature mapping file represents the translation of educational intentions
      (teaching CS concepts) into structured data (IT-CSP-6). It demonstrates data
      abstraction (IT-CSP-3) and follows design standards for organizing information
      (IT-NSS-9).
    contribution: "Links Ahab features to specific educational standards"

      - "IT-NSS-8"  # Troubleshoot network problems (validation as troubleshooting)
    rationale: |
      Validation scripts process structured data to identify errors (IT-CSP-4),
      implementing algorithms for consistency checking (IT-CSP-5). The validation
      process is analogous to network troubleshooting (IT-NSS-8) - both identify
      and report configuration issues.
    contribution: "Ensures referential integrity between features and standards"

  notes: |
    This mapping shows that the implementation tasks themselves teach important
    CS concepts. By completing these tasks, developers practice:
    - Algorithm development and analysis (IT-CSP-5)
    - Software development lifecycle (IT-PGAS-2)
    - Critical thinking and problem-solving (IT-ITS-1.3)
    - Data abstraction and representation (IT-CSP-3)
    - Professional communication (IT-ITS-1.1)
    
    The meta-lesson: Building educational infrastructure is itself educational.
