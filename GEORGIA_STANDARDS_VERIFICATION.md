**Ahab's Primary Alignment**: IT-NSS (Network Systems) and IT-ITS (IT Support) with foundational concepts from IT-CSP

### Additional Notes

- Each course includes employability skills (standard #1)
  - IT-ITS-1 has detailed sub-standards (1.1-1.6) breaking down employability skills
- Each course includes student organization participation (final standard)
- Standards are competency-based, not age-based
- Focus on career readiness and technical skills
- Aligned with industry certifications and workforce needs
- Some standards have sub-standards for more granular competencies

### Standard Numbering Pattern

**Primary Standards**: `[Course]-[Number]` (e.g., IT-NSS-7)
**Sub-Standards**: `[Course]-[Number].[Sub]` (e.g., IT-ITS-1.3)

This hierarchical structure allows for both broad competencies and specific skill breakdowns.
