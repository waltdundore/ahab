  # ============================================================================
  # Testing Components
  # ============================================================================
  
  hypothesis:
    category: "Testing"
    purpose: "Property-based testing library for Python that generates test cases automatically"
    why_chosen: "Enables comprehensive testing by generating hundreds of test cases automatically, catching edge cases that manual testing would miss. Essential for ensuring correctness of critical infrastructure code"
    what_is_pbt: |
      Property-based testing (PBT) is a testing methodology that verifies properties (rules) hold true across
      many randomly generated inputs, rather than testing specific examples. Instead of writing tests like
      "assert reverse([1,2,3]) == [3,2,1]", you write properties like "for any list x, reverse(reverse(x)) == x"
      and let the testing framework generate hundreds of different lists to test this property.
      
      Key benefits of PBT:
      - Finds edge cases you wouldn't think to test manually
      - Tests the general behavior, not just specific examples  
      - Provides better confidence that code works correctly
      - Automatically shrinks failing examples to minimal cases for easier debugging
      - Scales testing effort - one property tests hundreds of cases
      
      Example: Instead of testing "add_user('alice') should work", you test the property
      "for any valid username, add_user(username) should result in that user existing in the system"
      and Hypothesis generates hundreds of different usernames to test this property.
    alternatives:
      - name: "Manual example-based testing"
        reason_not_chosen: "Example-based tests only cover cases you think of. PBT finds edge cases automatically and provides much better coverage with less effort"
      - name: "QuickCheck (Haskell)"
        reason_not_chosen: "We use Python, and Hypothesis is the Python equivalent of QuickCheck with excellent integration"
      - name: "fast-check (JavaScript)"
        reason_not_chosen: "We need Python testing, though fast-check is excellent for JavaScript"
    usage_examples:
      - "Testing inventory validation properties in ahab-gui configuration management"
      - "Testing configuration parsing round-trip properties (parse then serialize should be identity)"
      - "Testing data model invariants across different input combinations"
      - "Validating that make command execution properties hold for all valid inputs"
      - "Testing that security validation functions correctly reject all invalid inputs"
    educational_context:
      industry_standard: true
      notable_users:
        - "Stripe - Uses property-based testing for payment processing correctness"
        - "Sentry - Uses Hypothesis for testing error handling and data processing"
        - "Django - Uses Hypothesis in their test suite for framework correctness"
        - "Mercurial - Uses property-based testing for version control operations"
        - "Many financial services companies for correctness-critical code"
      maturity: "Mature (since 2013, 10+ years of production use)"

          title: "An Introduction to Property-Based Testing"
          type: "tutorial"
      career_relevance: "Property-based testing is increasingly adopted in industry for critical systems where correctness matters. Companies like Stripe, banks, and aerospace use PBT for high-reliability code. Understanding PBT demonstrates advanced testing skills and is valuable for senior developer roles"
